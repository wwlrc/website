# Website

This is the repo for the Wye & Welsh Land Rover Club's website.

## Development Setup

1. Install bun for your system. See [https://bun.sh]

2. Run `bun install` to install the dependencies

3. Run `bun run dev` to test locally. This will automatically start a web server, and will output a URL that you can visit in a web browser.

## Building

Before pushing changes, make sure it builds statically by running `bun run build` (I should really add this in CI).
