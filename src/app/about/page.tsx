        This is a trial for showroom condition standard vehicles and is
        completely non damaging. The rules also allow 13 year olds to drive, so
        it is a great opportunity for the kids to show dad how to drive the
        family Disco or Freelander. They are completely non damaging and great
        family entertainment. If you look at the events list you will see that
        we intend to put on a lot more TYROs this coming year.

        These are for specialist vehicles and so are much harder and can be

        vehicles are not necessarily road legal. The building regulations for
        these vehicles are not the same as for the Competitive Safari vehicles.

        This event is much the same as a CCVT, but it is timed. A set target

        penalty point for every second you spend over the target time completing
        the course.

      <h5 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Who are we?</h5>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The club was set up, in July 1987, by a group of mainly Land Rover
        owners who lived mostly in the Wye Valley and the Forest of Dean. It was
        set up to promote the use and ownership of Rover products.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Our membership is now over a hundred and growing. We cover an area from
        Hereford in the North East down toward Gloucester and all points West.
        We have an active membership and cover all aspects of Land Rover
        ownership. Most of our members are owners and users of Land Rovers,
        arguably the best 4x4 in the world (well we think so anyway).
      </p>
      <h5 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">What do we do?</h5>
      <p className="mb-2">
        The club exists for the members and for the promotion of Rover products.
        Whether you are a proud owner of a brand new Range Rover, Discovery,
        Freelander, Defender or the owner of a not so new Series Land Rover with
        not a straight panel in sight there is a warm welcome awaiting.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        We try to organise events every month. These events are :-

        We proudly host our own annual interclub competition, the{" "}

        Finally, the largest event in the land rovering calendar is the ALRC
        National Rally; competitors come from clubs all across the UK and abroad
        come together to compete against each other. ALRC member clubs bid to
        host it each year, and it can also by ran by the ALRC themslves. We have
        hosted this event twice, once in 2013 and again in 2023.
